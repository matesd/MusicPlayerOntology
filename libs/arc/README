Requirements
------------

1. You need to have
  - a WWW server with PHP5 or PHP4.3 or higher.
  - MySQL 4.0.4 or higher.


Installation
------------

1. Download ARC2 (http://arc.semsol.org) and unzip it.
  - Eg. http://arc.semsol.org/download/2009/03/05/arc.zip

2. Edit the parameters in config.php.

3. Create the database with the name you used for db_name in the config.
  - Either use a graphical MySQL administration interface such as phpmyadmin,
  - Or run the following command in the shell:
    mysql -h localhost -u config_db_user -p -e "create database config_db_name;"

4. Move this 'arc2sparql' directory to a web server directory.

5. You can restrict access to the SPARQL server using the following methods:

  a) You can set read and write API keys that clients need to match.
    - Edit config.php and set endpoint_*_keys to something hard to guess.

  b) Add access control rules (password, IP address) to a .htaccess file.

6. That's all! You can now access endpoint.php with a web browser.


Example .htaccess file for controlling access
---------------------------------------------

To restrict who can access the SPARQL endpoint by IP address, you can put 
the following lines (please adjust accordinly) into .htaccess:

Order deny,allow
Deny from all

# List IP addresses of the clients that should be allowed 
Allow from 127.0.0.1 # localhost, ie. access from the same machine
Allow from 194.187.213.68 # tuukka.iki.fi
